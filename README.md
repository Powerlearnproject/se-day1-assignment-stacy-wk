Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Examples of activities involved in software engineering are: designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software products.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in technology - This led to a more structured and systematic approach where engineering principles were used to improve reliability, efficiency and maintainability.
Development of programming languages - These programming languages, e.g., Fortran, C introduced structured programming and in turn making software development more manageable.
Rise of Agile methodologies - This introduced a new approach to software development that led to faster software delivery and better response to user needs as emphasis was put on iterative and incremental development.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning and rquirements analysis: defining the project objectives and scope, gathering and documenting software requirements and user needs
Design: high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture are created
Implementation: the actual code is written by developers according to design specifications
Testing: various test are conducted on the software to ensure optimal functionality and quality standards are met
Deployment: the tested software is released to the users
Maintenance: after deployment, ongoing support, updates and improvements are required to ensure long-term usability and keep up with the new changing requirements



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies are linear and sequential hence less flexible while Agile methodologies are iterative and incremental hence highly adaptable because changes can be made throughout the project.
Examples of scenarios where Waterfall methodologies would be appropriate: airplane software systems, banking software systems, software used in the manufacturing industry, medical device software
Examples of scenarios where Agile methodologies would be appropriate: e-commerce websites, social media platforms, delivery apps, game development



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - writes code and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures quality of software by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager - supervises the planning, execution, and delivery of software products


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - provide comprehensive tools for writing, testing and debugging code. Examples include: IntelliJ IDEA, Pycharm, Visual Studio Code
VCS - facilitates tracking of changes to source code and coordinating work among developers working in a team. Examples include: Git, Subversion, Mercurial


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines and limited time: use of agile methodologies, break tasks into smaller bite-sized pieces, use of online tools for task management, regular reassessment of timelines
Rapidly changing technologies: follow tech blogs and join developer communities to keep up with new and upcoming languages, frameworks and tools
Changing requirements: regular check-ins between developers and clients to align expectations
Handling complex codebases: using Git for version control, following consistent naming conventions for order
Burnout: taking breaks, setting work-life boundaries, prioritization and managing of tasks




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: tests individual components or modules of software and it ensures that individual pieces of code function correctly enabling developers to catch bugs early
Integration testing: tests interactions between different components or subsystems and it helps to catch issues like mismatches and faulty connections, e.g., API mismatches
System testing: tests the entire software system as a whole and it helps to validate the system before deployment
Acceptance testing: tests the software against user requirements to ensure that the software meets user needs and expectations


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to crafting clear and specific instructions, contexts or cues to get the best responses or actions from an AI model.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Generate a picture of a city
Clear, specific and concise prompt: Generate an aerial view of a rainy city at night with vintage cars and skyscrapers and apply a black-and-white filter with deep shadows to give the feel of a thrilling detective movie
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides immense detail and provide context. For example in our case, the AI now knows what mood to create and what visual and stylistic elements to add to our image
